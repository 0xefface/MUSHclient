@w[01 Jan 19:03:08] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YFishy: aoe attack
@w[01 Jan 19:03:11] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YDrin: not until you get an AOE (area of effect) attack
@w[01 Jan 19:03:23] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YGeuston: ok, thanks
@w[01 Jan 19:03:37] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@RImm@W)@Y @YAnaristos: no, but you can enter multiple attack commands each with a different target in the room. Note that the weapons will only engage the first target.
@w[01 Jan 19:03:39] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YKaelthys: you could make an alias. if you wanted to do it with a single target attack, but that kinda defeats the point
@w[01 Jan 19:03:50] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YDrin: you can however use a skill to engage a second opponent while still fighting your first opponent.

@w[01 Jan 19:07:16] @GMagna answers 'it's added to the player, not just to that one weapon (so, for example, dr on an offhand weapon makes your primary weapon hit harder)'

@w[01 Jan 19:08:09] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@RImm@W)@Y @YAnaristos: Searos, that happens because too much data is being sent to you over the connection at once. Use pagesize to get a smaller stream.

@w[01 Jan 19:09:21] @GMagna answers 'for the most part, for your weapon you should look for damage first'
@w[01 Jan 19:10:13] @GMagna answers 'the issue is that compare scores cannot be set differently for armor as for weapons, so the default values had to be pretty generalized'
@w[01 Jan 19:10:39] @CDexx gossips '2 minutes left on enchanters focus'
@w[01 Jan 19:10:50] @GMagna answers 'this means that a weapon with crappy damage will be scored higher than one with good damage if it has some stats added to it'

@w[01 Jan 19:12:12] @GMagna answers 'you should NOT be evaluating equipment based on scores, that doesn't tell you "which is better", it's just a rough guideline to get you started (just like you shouldn't be using the bare items from eqsearch once you're more experienced...you should be getting enchanted sets from enchanters)'
@w[01 Jan 19:12:19] @CLundfu gossips 'eq'
@w[01 Jan 19:12:31] @GDrin answers 'it depends on how you have compare set, for default a stat is worth about 2.5 points of average damage, which doesn't sound crazy.'

@w[01 Jan 22:36:40] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAeacien: so tier upgrade is like a reroll, but you retain all the skills you learned?
@w[01 Jan 22:37:20] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YFishy: tier reset all skill
@w[01 Jan 22:37:32] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YPleiades: if you tier, you start over so to speak

@w[01 Jan 22:39:10] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLyrik: from what i've read i'm sure i will have a ton of questions when i hit 200
@w[01 Jan 22:39:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAeacien: is there a threshold at which a lot of the content really opens up?
@w[01 Jan 22:39:36] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAeacien: sort of like "hit level 200, then you can do raids" etc
@w[01 Jan 22:40:30] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YPleiades: you'd want some hp in order to survive those
@w[01 Jan 22:40:58] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YPleiades: and the game constantly evolves, so it's now easier for poeple to participate in higher level activities

@w[01 Jan 22:47:54] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAeacien: are there any "suggested for beginners" builds, or is it pretty much all good to go?

@w[03 Jan 19:50:58] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: ninja is nice for the backstab when already in combat, but it doesnt add up to very much
@w[03 Jan 19:51:20] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRaikage: Yeah that just helps me get backstab in for aggro monsters
@w[03 Jan 19:51:36] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Bandit's big things are ways to earn extra gold, nothing special combat wise...excpet the entrap (which is for pk purposes).
@w[03 Jan 19:51:55] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: yep, and you only get 2 hits on that, whereas being invis and quick will get you a possible five hit backstab even on aggros, depending on the mob of course

@w[03 Jan 22:01:52] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Yshould i take the advice of eqsearch over comparing items?
@w[03 Jan 22:02:16] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Ydoes eqsearch take into account my class?
@w[03 Jan 22:02:30] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YEmeris: It sure does :)
@w[03 Jan 22:02:34] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLiber: have you check your 'compare set'?
@w[03 Jan 22:03:16] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YEmeris: If you are say a fighter, and you make a mage alt you'll notice eqsearch will guide you opposite directions...
@w[03 Jan 22:03:54] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Yliber what is compare set supposed to tell me?  all of the numbers match
@w[03 Jan 22:04:50] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YEmeris: as a psi eqsearch should guide you to int/wis/luck stuff primarily
@w[03 Jan 22:05:12] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLiber: but not all are the same :) that is how the score from 'eqsearch' is computed. you'll see there some stats receive more points that the other stats

@w[03 Jan 22:08:24] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLiber: if you're wearing that item, does eqsearch still recommend the one with the lower score?

@w[03 Jan 22:13:35] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLiber: I get it that it doesn't recommend the lower score item :) The idea is that eqsearch does NOT check all the equipment in the game. There's a note, each time you check for equipment: Note: * Searchable item list is only a small portion of game items.

@w[03 Jan 22:16:35] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Ycompare set is still confusing even after reading the help file, I'm missing something because I don't understand the point of that command
@w[03 Jan 22:18:15] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLiber: Generally speaking, 'compare' compares the score of two items. 'compare set' allows you to finely tune how the items are scored. 
@w[03 Jan 22:18:37] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@RImm@W)@Y @YAnaristos: read help compare
@w[03 Jan 22:19:58] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Yi have read the help file and it is still not making sense Anaristos.
@w[03 Jan 22:20:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLiber: for example, as a pclass psi, your equipment will receive 50% more points for int/wis, 20% more points for luck, and some points for hr/dr. the score you see in compare, and also in eqsearch, is obtained by multplying the number of stats with the 'compare set' points
@w[03 Jan 22:21:22] @CDexx gossips '2 minutes left on enchanters focus'
@w[03 Jan 22:21:32] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YLiber: that's why a +4 str, for you, will be scored lower than a +3 wis. you can tune it to your liking thogh :)

@w[03 Jan 22:25:44] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Yso the vlues defined in 'compare set' are like weighted values and can be increased based on my preference which will in turn alter the score of equipment when comparing?

@w[04 Jan 19:09:08] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: so typically the general rule is to train all stats evenly until they cost two trains and then focus on your primary stat without neglecting the other important stats too much
@w[04 Jan 19:09:25] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: but never train hp, mana or moves

@w[04 Jan 19:11:39] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: theres a lot of different opinions on how much to train each stat etc, but yes wisdom is your primary, con is also important because it affects your defense and like you said your hp gained, int is also pretty vital to you as it affects how much mana you gain per level
@w[04 Jan 19:11:55] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: strength and dex are not all that important for you but dont neglect them completely

@w[04 Jan 19:12:41] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: and luck will always give small benefits so training a few extra in that wont really hurt either
@w[04 Jan 19:12:54] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YXaiphos: yeah, i remember the mud i played years ago, maxing you con and int quick was paramount to get the level gains. since the damage from say wis would just catch up eventually, and wondered if it was the same here
@w[04 Jan 19:13:12] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YFishy: do i need to train my int and wis as a thief?
@w[04 Jan 19:13:54] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YLevel: you should train all stats untill they cost 2 then focus on your classes primary stats
@w[04 Jan 19:13:57] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: the stat system is so complex here, i wouldnt focus too much on any one stat in particular just make sure your wis is high for the most part and read the helpfile for each stat thoroughly, help wis, help con etc

@w[04 Jan 19:15:03] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: as a thief i only get my int up to 60 then stop training it completely (thats about the time it costs 2 trains) and then wis i do a bit more because im multi-class so my other classes depend on wis for their spell effectiveness
@w[04 Jan 19:16:12] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YKobus: but like i said, read the helps thoroughly and decide what you think is important and then its just a matter of trying different things
